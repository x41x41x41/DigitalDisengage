# Digital Disengage
This project is intended to document how to eject someone/something from your account, should you suspect that they have access. 

Unfortunately, I had to provide this information when asked for advice about how to eject an ex-partner that was using their access to spy on the individual. So rather than just keep it as an email I thought it would be better to collate the information for others to use.

# Want to contribute?
Create an MD file for the service in question and then a step by step guide to how to eject someone/something from the service.

The rough steps (regardless of service) are likely to be similar to the below

1. Check recovery information is correct and as expected
2. Remove any application specific passwords or alternative access
3. Change your password
4. Clear any existing sessions and remove any connected devices
5. Go back to 1/2/5 and ensure information hasn't been added back

But don't forget about other things such as third party connections, shared resources (i.e oneDrive folders), and automations that may forward stuff to a third party (i.e autoforwarding rules).

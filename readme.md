# Digital Disengage
This project is intended to document how to eject someone/something from your account, should you suspect that they have access. 

Unfortunately, I had to provide this information when asked for advice about how to eject a partner from various services that was using their access to spy on someone. So rather than just keep it as an email I thought it would be better to collate the information for others to use.

# Want to contribute?
Create an MD file for the service in question and then a step by step guide to how to eject someone/something from the service.
